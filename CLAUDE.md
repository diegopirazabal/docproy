### Analysis Summary

# Buying a Ticket Workflow

The process of buying a ticket involves interactions between the **Frontend** (React application) and the **Backend** (Spring Boot application). The workflow generally follows these steps: selecting a trip and seats, proceeding to checkout, and finally processing the payment.

## High-Level Architecture

The system is composed of a **Frontend** [frontend/](frontend/) and a **Backend** [back/](back/) service. The **Frontend** handles the user interface and makes API calls to the **Backend** for data retrieval and transaction processing. The **Backend** manages business logic, data persistence, and integrates with external services like PayPal for payments.

## Mid-Level Components and Interactions

### Frontend Application

The frontend application, built with React, guides the user through the ticket purchasing process.

#### **Trip and Seat Selection**

*   **`ClienteSeleccionAsientosPage.js`** [frontend/src/pages/cliente/ClienteSeleccionAsientosPage.js]: This component is responsible for displaying the available seats for a selected trip and allowing the user to choose their desired seats. It likely interacts with the backend to fetch seat availability and to temporarily reserve seats.

#### **Checkout Process**

*   **`ClienteCheckoutPage.js`** [frontend/src/pages/cliente/ClienteCheckoutPage.js]: This page handles the final review of the selected tickets and initiates the payment process. It gathers necessary information from the user and prepares the data to be sent to the backend for purchase.

### Backend Service

The backend service, built with Spring Boot, provides the APIs for managing trips, seats, and processing payments.

#### **Client-Facing Controllers**

*   **`ClienteController.java`** [back/src/main/java/com/omnibus/backend/controller/ClienteController.java]: This controller exposes endpoints related to client operations, which would include functionalities for searching trips, selecting seats, and potentially initiating the ticket purchase.
*   **`PaypalController.java`** [back/src/main/java/com/omnibus/backend/controller/PaypalController.java]: This controller handles the integration with the PayPal payment gateway. It receives requests from the frontend to create and capture PayPal orders.

#### **Business Logic and Services**

*   **`pasajeService.java`** [back/src/main/java/com/omnibus/backend/service/pasajeService.java]: This service class encapsulates the core business logic for managing "pasajes" (tickets). It would be responsible for:
    *   Validating seat selections.
    *   Creating new ticket entries in the database.
    *   Handling the association of tickets with users and trips.
    *   Potentially managing the state of a ticket (e.g., pending, confirmed, cancelled).
*   **`PaypalService.java`** [back/src/main/java/com/omnibus/backend/service/PaypalService.java]: This service interacts directly with the PayPal API to process payments. It would be called by the `PaypalController` to create and capture payment orders.

#### **Data Transfer Objects (DTOs)**

*   **`CompraPasajeRequestDTO.java`** [back/src/main/java/com/omnibus/backend/dto/CompraPasajeRequestDTO.java]: This DTO is likely used to carry the data for a single ticket purchase request from the frontend to the backend. It would contain details such as the trip ID, selected seat, and passenger information.
*   **`CompraMultiplePasajesRequestDTO.java`** [back/src/main/java/com/omnibus/backend/dto/CompraMultiplePasajesRequestDTO.java]: This DTO would be used for purchasing multiple tickets in a single transaction, containing a list of individual ticket details.
*   **`PasajeResponseDTO.java`** [back/src/main/java/com/omnibus/backend/dto/PasajeResponseDTO.java]: This DTO would be used to send ticket-related information back to the frontend after a purchase or query.

#### **Data Persistence**

*   **`PasajeRepository.java`** [back/src/main/java/com/omnibus/backend/repository/PasajeRepository.java]: This repository interface provides methods for performing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on the `Pasaje` (ticket) entities in the database.
*   **`Pasaje.java`** [back/src/main/java/com/omnibus/backend/model/Pasaje.java]: This is the JPA entity representing a ticket in the database, defining its structure and relationships with other entities like `Viaje` (trip) and `Usuario` (user).

## Low-Level Implementation Details

The exact flow for buying a ticket would involve:

1.  User navigates to a trip selection page (not explicitly identified but implied).
2.  User selects a trip, leading to the **`ClienteSeleccionAsientosPage.js`** [frontend/src/pages/cliente/ClienteSeleccionAsientosPage.js] to choose seats.
3.  The frontend sends a request to the backend (likely via **`ClienteController`** [back/src/main/java/com/omnibus/backend/controller/ClienteController.java]) to check seat availability and potentially reserve them.
4.  Once seats are selected, the user proceeds to the **`ClienteCheckoutPage.js`** [frontend/src/pages/cliente/ClienteCheckoutPage.js].
5.  On the checkout page, the frontend prepares a purchase request using DTOs like **`CompraPasajeRequestDTO`** [back/src/main/java/com/omnibus/backend/dto/CompraPasajeRequestDTO.java] or **`CompraMultiplePasajesRequestDTO`** [back/src/main/java/com/omnibus/backend/dto/CompraMultiplePasajesRequestDTO.java].
6.  This request is sent to the backend, likely to an endpoint in **`ClienteController`** [back/src/main/java/com/omnibus/backend/controller/ClienteController.java] or a dedicated purchase controller.
7.  The backend's **`pasajeService.java`** [back/src/main/java/com/omnibus/backend/service/pasajeService.java] processes the request, validates the purchase, and interacts with the **`PasajeRepository`** [back/src/main/java/com/omnibus/backend/repository/PasajeRepository.java] to persist the ticket information.
8.  For payment, the frontend interacts with the **`PaypalController.java`** [back/src/main/java/com/omnibus/backend/controller/PaypalController.java], which in turn uses the **`PaypalService.java`** [back/src/main/java/com/omnibus/backend/service/PaypalService.java] to communicate with the PayPal API.
9.  Upon successful payment and ticket creation, the backend returns a response (e.g., using **`PasajeResponseDTO`** [back/src/main/java/com/omnibus/backend/dto/PasajeResponseDTO.java]) to the frontend, confirming the purchase.
10. The user might then be redirected to a page listing their purchased tickets, possibly handled by **`ClienteListarPasajes.js`** [frontend/src/pages/cliente/ClienteListarPasajes.js].
